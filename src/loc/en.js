  aboutUsPara2: `In this way, the treatment of sick cows became routine and people started to be informed, so if a sick cow is found anywhere, people started to report it. Gradually, by doing this, the cost started to increase. The people who gave voluntarily started to see the good work and the people started to see the good work. After deducting the treatment expenses, they decided to make laddus for cows and dogs and feed them in the whole village.`,

  aboutUsPara3: `Thus, the people continued to cooperate and the work also increased and the space started getting short for keeping the sick cows. We spoke to the municipality to find out which place you would cooperate with, then we can work. The municipality was a waste place He showed us the place where there was a pit thirty feet deep from the road and decided to build a cow shed on that place.`,
